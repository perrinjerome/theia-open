# theia-open

A [theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia) extension to open files from command line.

This exposes a server side API to open/close and editor and query if the editor is still open and a command line interface.

This is intendent to use as an `$EDITOR` environment variable so htat opening files from the terminal open in a theia editor.

This is a reimplementation of a [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) feature.
